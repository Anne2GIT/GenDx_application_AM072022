### Description: convert DNA sequence of the allele HLA-A stored in .txt format into two fastq format files(R1 and R2).  

#### Hardware/software
Windows 10 Home 21H1 <br/>
R version 4.1.0 <br/>
Rstudio Version 1.1.463 <br/>


#### Motivation for using R:
I chose to work in R, because of time constraints.Recieving the alternative assignment at work,<br/> 
I looked into my schedule and estimated 5-8 hours tops that I could scrape together to meet the<br/> 
deadline. I would have liked to have done it in Python or Java, knowing that you guys mostly work with <br/>
C#, but seeing how little time I had and how thorough I wanted to be, I chose the language I'm <br/>
currently most proficient in (having worked with it the past 6 months).<br/>

#### Directory setup:
The project directory contains two files; the README (README.MD) and the code (txt_to_fastq.R).<br/>
The project directory contains two subdirectories; Input, containing the HLA-A allele sequence<br/>
and Output, where the generated R1 and R2 fastq files are placed.<br/>
